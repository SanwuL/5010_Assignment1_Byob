I noted that the system appears relatively complex and was not sure whether the assignment requirements called for this level of detail. I could not clearly recall whether the specification required commands to be this long, and questioned whether the four-bit limitation applied to the entire command or to each individual part of the command.

Additionally, I had some confusion regarding how triangles are drawn in the system. In particular, it was unclear how the orientation or direction of a triangle is determined based on the current rules.

The answer to the challenge: 

0000 01 0100

0001 11 1000

0101 11 1000

1001 11 1000

1001 11 0100

1010 11 0100

1011 11 1000

0110 10 0100 ？(unsure)
